I am currently a PhD student at the [State Key Laboratory of Scientific and Engineering Computing](https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/), [Institute of Computational Mathematics and Scientific/Engineering Computing](https://icmsec.cc.ac.cn/), [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science](http://www.amss.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.ac.cn/). I graduated from the [School of Mathematics of Jilin University](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2024 with a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. My research interests include log-concave sampling, optimization, optimal transport.

## Hobbies and Interests
I am passionate about traveling and have visited many countries and regions. I take pleasure in quietly appreciating the elegance of mathematics, constantly discovering its magical aspects. In addition, I also enjoy fish-touching, water-skiing, sleeping and eating.
